The purpose of this project was to learn how to use DBT and Big Query

The project involved reading from Big Query's free API containing github repositories and stack overflow posts, along with a CSV listing organizations. 
We had to create a mart layer combining specific information about the organizations activity on github, and the types of posts on stack overflow.

One interesting fact I learned from this project is that Apache Airflow employees have a disproportionally high amount of github activity on Saturdays and Sundays.
